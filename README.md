Code repository for "Quantum error correction: deep learning approach for noise mitigation"
"four_qubits" contains the code for the training of the FFNN on simple noise models.
"four_qubits_brisbane" contains code for the training on the realistic noise model for 4-qubit states.
"three_qubits_brisbane" contains code for the training on the realistic noise model for 3-qubit states.
